# Scientific-Python-Tutorials
A series of tutorial notebooks outline some basics of using Python for scientific computing. Numerical solutions of elementary cellular automata (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) is the motivating task. We start with intuitive implementation CA simulation using Python dictionaries and native for-loops. Some details of writing good "Pythonic" code, including the use of functions and classes, are described. We then show how to speed up the simulation code first using numpy, then numba.
